# The Virtual Brain Node: Personalized Simulations for Cognitive Neuroscience 

### Welcome to the repository for **SFU’s Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN)'s TVB Node Workshop**:  

---

## Workshop Overview  
**Date & Time:** March 6, 2026, 8:00 AM – 5:30 PM  
**Location:** Vancouver, BC, Canada (in conjunction with the Cognitive Neuroscience Society 2026 Annual Meeting)  

This workshop introduces participants to **personalized brain network modeling** using [TheVirtualBrain (TVB)](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org) — an open-source platform for simulating large-scale brain dynamics grounded in empirical data. Designed for cognitive neuroscientists, the session combines conceptual foundations with hands-on experience.

### Topics covered include: 

- Core principles of nonlinear brain dynamics  
- TVB software architecture and workflows  
- Building the components of a simple TVB simulation  
- Tuning models and model parameter optimization
- Evaluating model performance and validity  
- Applications of TVB in ageing and pediatric research

## Pre-Workshop Preparation  

Prior to the session participants are asked to complete all pre-session steps in the [**pre-session materials**](/Pre-Session_Materials) folder:  

1. **Complete a brief [pre-session survey](https://forms.office.com/r/Mi4dPaDyMN)**.  
2. **Install & verify the software environment container** according to the [instructions](/Pre-Session_Materials#task-2-tvb-install-setup-and-verification) provided.  
3. **Watch preparatory recordings** covering foundational TVB concepts.
4. **Bring a laptop and charger** to the session. Your computer should have at least 4 GB of RAM and 4 GB of storage.
